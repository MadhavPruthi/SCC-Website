                                Information also enables our users to establish a user account and profile that
                                can be used to interact with Treatment Providers and other users through the Site. We
                                only collect
                                Personal Information we consider important to achieve that goal.
                                You always have the option not to provide some, or any, Personal Information by
                                either choosing not to become a registered user of the Services, or else by

                                Information is being collected. You can use some of the Services anonymously,
                                but once you become a registered user of the Services, we will ask you to
                                provide Personal Information, such as:</p>

                                information (“<b>PHI</b>”). PHI is
                                information about you that may be used to identify you (such as your name,
                                social security number, or address), and that relates to (a) your past,
                                present, or future physical or mental health or condition, (b) the provision of
                                health care to you, or (c) your past, present, or future payment for the
                                provision of health care. In providing the Services, we will receive and create records
                                containing your PHI, and may use it to assist you in scheduling appointments, remind you
                                of upcoming or follow-up appointments, inform you of canceled appointments, allow
                                Treatment Providers to make appointments with other Treatment Providers on your behalf
                                through the Services, bill amounts due for health care services provided by a Treatment
                                Provider under the Services or the Site, develop and conduct surveys with you to assist
                                in providing you better Services, conduct our management and administrative activities,
                                and otherwise as stated in this Privacy Policy. We may also use your de-identified PHI
                                to run (or authorize third parties to run) statistical research on individual or
                                aggregate health or medical trends. Such research would only use your PHI in an
                                anonymous manner that cannot be tied directly back to you. We are required by law to
                                maintain the privacy and confidentiality of your PHI, and we operate the Services
                                consistent with applicable federal and state laws governing health information privacy
                                and security.</p>

                                Privacy Policy describes how we protect your privacy as a general user of the
                                Services, not as a patient receiving mental health advice or consultation
                                through the Services from a Treatment Provider. If you are a patient receiving
                                mental health advice or consultations through the Services from a Treatment
                                Provider, you have other rights with respect to the access, use, and disclosure
                                of PHI. For a more complete description of a patient’s rights under HIPAA,
                                please refer to your Treatment Provider’s Notice of Privacy Practices, which
                                provides important information to you about how your PHI may be used and

                                search for on our Services, access times and dates, and other statistics. We
                                use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Services and for the
                                Services’ technical administration, to increase our Services’ functionality and
                                user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors’ needs. For
                                example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the
                                Services again, it will recognize you and provide information appropriate to
                                your interests. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the
                                Services meet the criteria required to process their requests.</p>
                            <p>Generally,
                                our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and
                                frequency of visitors to our site and its components, similar to TV ratings
                                that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Calm Minds only
                                uses these data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not
                                in a manner that would identify you personally. These type of aggregate data
                                enable us to figure out how often users use parts of the Site or the Services
                                so that we can improve the Services.</p>

                                also use “<b>cookies</b>” to collect
                                information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s
                                hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes.
                                First, we may utilize persistent cookies to save your user credentials for future logins
                                to the Services. Second, we may utilize session ID
                                cookies to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how
                                you interact with the Services and to monitor aggregate usage by users of the
                                Services and web traffic routing on the Services. Unlike persistent cookies,
                                session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the
                                Services and then close your browser. We may work with third parties that place or read
                                cookies on your browser to improve your user experience.

                                “<b>web</b> <b>bugs</b>,” “<b>1-pixel gifs</b>,” etc.) that allow us to collect

                                information about your response to our email communications, and for other
                                purposes. Web beacons are tiny images, placed on a Web page or e-mail, that
                                can tell us if you have visited a particular area of the Services. For
                                example, if you have given us permission to send you emails, we may send you an
                                email urging you to use a certain feature of the Services. If you do respond
                                to that email and use that feature, the web beacon will tell us that our email
                                communication with you has been successful. We do not collect any PHI with a
                                web beacon, and do not link web beacons with any PHI you have given us.</p>
                            <p>Because
                                Web beacons are used in conjunction with persistent cookies (described above),
                                if you set your browser to decline or deactivate cookies, Web beacons cannot
                                function.</p>

                                may use a third-party vendor to help us manage some of our email communications
                                with you. While we may supply this vendor with email addresses of those we
                                wish them to contact, your email address is never used for any purpose other
                                than to communicate with you on our or your Treatment Provider's behalf. When you click
                                on a link in an
                                email, you may temporarily be redirected through one of the vendor’s servers
                                (although this process will be invisible to you) which will register that you
                                have clicked on that link, and have visited our Services. We also often
                                receive a confirmation when you open an email from Calm Minds if your
                                computer supports this type of program. Calm Minds uses this confirmation to
                                help us make emails more useful to you.</p>
                            <p>Secure electronic messaging is always preferred to insecure email, but under specific
                                circumstances, insecure email communication containing PHI may take place between you
                                and Calm Minds.</p>
                            <p>For your convenience, Calm Minds lets you choose whether to receive email
                                communications containing PHI. This email communication is not encrypted and may include
                                messages from your Treatment Provider, appointment reminders, treatment referrals, and
                                prescription information.</p>
                            <p>You should consider that standard email is not a secure means of communication. There is
                                some risk that any PHI contained in email may be disclosed to, or intercepted, printed,
                                or stored by, unauthorized third parties. Calm Minds cannot ensure the security or
                                confidentiality of messages sent by email.</p>
                            <p>You will receive email communication from Calm Minds and Treatment Providers. If you
                                choose to receive PHI in emails, you authorize Calm Minds to send you messages that
                                include PHI, which may include disclosure of mental illness, substance abuse, and
                                sexually transmitted disease. This authorization indicates you understand and accept the
                                risks involved with insecure email communication of your PHI.</p>
                            <p>You may always elect not to receive message content containing PHI. In that case, you
                                would instead receive secure notifications of new messages that require you to log in to
                                Calm Minds’s secure site to read message content. We recommend this option if you want
                                to increase the security and confidentiality of your communications on
                                Calm Minds. </p>
                            <p>Even if you have requested us to send email containing PHI to you, you may revoke this
